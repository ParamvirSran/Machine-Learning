I urge you to tackle this assignment independently and perhaps in a self-timed setup, without relying on AI tools or seeking assistance from friends. This is a chance for you to assess your own capabilities and ensure that you're prepared for the challenges ahead. By completing this task on your own, you'll gain valuable insights into your strengths and areas for improvement, which will ultimately benefit you in the final exam.</span>\n","\n","### Once you are finished, ensure to complete the following steps:\n","\n","1.
