    "# Introduction to Keras and Shallow Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will create our first neural network. It will be a shallow one, over a small dataset, so it is not a good example of a real-life problem where neural networks shine, but it will be a great way to understand the network architectures and what can we do with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, and in general in future examples, we will closely follow the book \"Deep Learning with Python\" by Chollet. The library has copies of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will import one of the data examples from Keras itself: House Prices in Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, what is Keras?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is the high level API of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), Google's deep learning software. Deep Learning requires a set of very sophisticated optimizers and computational calculations, so it can be tricky to program directly. Luckily for us, we can simply use Keras to call the more sophisticated programs that will do the heavy lifting for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, Keras is a \"front-end\", while the calculation engine will be a \"backend\". Those backends will actually call a backend of their own which will communicate with the machine itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to configure your own environment in your PC, and have an Nvidia GPU at home or your laptop, please follow the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda Python from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Follow the steps [here](https://shawnhymel.com/2034/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-windows/) on Windows to configure your Python environment with tensorflow. There are many, many tutorials online on how to do this for multiple platforms. Other tutorials here for [Mac](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/01/30/macos-mojave-install-tensorflow-and-keras-for-deep-learning/) or [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/01/30/ubuntu-18-04-install-tensorflow-and-keras-for-deep-learning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue using Google Colab's environment, so you don't need to do this. What we need to do is to change our execution environment to a GPU one. For that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click Runtime\n",
    "- Select \"Change runtime type\"\n",
    "- In the menu, in the combo box below \"Hardware Accelerator\" select GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an even more powerful environment: TPU, but this requires a change in coding so we will omit it for this introduction. If you are curious and want to try it out, check out [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/tpu.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to use Keras!"
