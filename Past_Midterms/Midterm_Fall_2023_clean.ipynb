    "- Use of AI agents such as ChatGPT and Copilot is considered an act of cheating and you will receive 0 mark for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to use any other resources on your computer or the internet, but you are **not** allowed to share documents, post questions to forums such as Stack Overflow (this includes use of homework helpers such as Chegg), or communicate in anyway with people inside or outside the exam room.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having any communication tools (*e.g.*, Discord, Teams, Slack, Outlook etc.) either web-based or app-based open on your computer (or having them running in the background) is considered an act of cheating and you will receive 0 mark for the exam.\n",

    "- You must have your work submitted by 5:30PM to the \"Test and Quizzes\" section of the course's site on OWL, *i.e.*, the same place where you originally downloaded the notebook. Late submissions will be scored with 0 mark unless one has an approved accommodation for submitting late. Therefore, to avoid technical difficulties at the time of submission, please initiate your submission process at the latest five minutes before the deadline. \n",

    "- If at any point you are asking yourself \"are we supposed to...\", write your assumptions clearly and proceed according to them.\n",

    "- If you have no clue how to approach a question, skip it, and move on. Revisit the skipped one(s) after you are done with other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where applicable, take advantage of the argument `n_jobs=-1` to speed up processes with parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To navigate within the notebook, better to take advantage of the notebook's table of contents (normally on the left side of the screen). It saves you time compared to pure mouse scrolling. In VScode, it is nested under the \"OUTLINE\" tab which is by default minimized unless you click it to maximize.\n",
